# MLOPS Project: Custom Architecture

## Introduction

Welcome to our MLOPS project! This project focuses on implementing a custom architecture for MLOPS (Machine Learning Operations), emphasizing data versioning and model versioning. The goal is to streamline the machine learning lifecycle, from data preparation to model deployment, ensuring reproducibility, scalability, and maintainability.

## Features

* **Data Versioning:** Implement a robust system for tracking and versioning datasets. Ensure traceability and reproducibility of experiments by associating each model with the specific dataset version used during training.
* **Model Versioning:** Develop a model versioning mechanism that captures the evolution of machine learning models over time. Track changes to model architecture, hyperparameters, and training data.
* **Automated Best Model Selection:** Implement a process for automatically selecting the best-performing model based on predefined metrics. This enhances efficiency and allows for the deployment of the most effective models.
* **Scalable Architecture:** Design an architecture that scales seamlessly with growing datasets and increasing model complexity. Consider incorporating cloud-based solutions for scalability and resource efficiency.
* **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing, model training, and deployment. Ensure a smooth and efficient workflow from development to production.
