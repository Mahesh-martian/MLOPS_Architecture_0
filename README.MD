## Features

* **Data Versioning:** Implement a robust system for tracking and versioning datasets. Ensure traceability and reproducibility of experiments by associating each model with the specific dataset version used during training.
* **Model Versioning:** Develop a model versioning mechanism that captures the evolution of machine learning models over time. Track changes to model architecture, hyperparameters, and training data.
* **Automated Best Model Selection:** Implement a process for automatically selecting the best-performing model based on predefined metrics. This enhances efficiency and allows for the deployment of the most effective models.
* **Scalable Architecture:** Design an architecture that scales seamlessly with growing datasets and increasing model complexity. Consider incorporating cloud-based solutions for scalability and resource efficiency.
* **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing, model training, and deployment. Ensure a smooth and efficient workflow from development to production.
